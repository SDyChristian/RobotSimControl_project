# ðŸ¤– Robot Simulation and Control Library

This project provides a **modular, extensible, and fully numerical framework** for simulating and controlling serial robotic manipulators using **Python** and **NumPy**.

Designed with object-oriented principles, this library enables you to implement essential robotic algorithms without relying on symbolic computation or external simulation platforms. It is intended for both educational and research purposes, offering a solid base for extensions into advanced modeling and control.
