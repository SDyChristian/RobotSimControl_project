# Robot Kinematics in Python

This project implements a modular and extensible framework for computing the forward kinematics of a serial robot using Python and NumPy.

It is structured using object-oriented programming and designed for future extensions such as control, dynamics, or simulation tools.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Forward kinematics based on homogeneous transformation matrices  
- Skew-symmetric matrix utility for rotation computations  
- Modular structure (separated into config, models, kinematics, and utilities)  
- Easily extendable for dynamic modeling or control algorithms  

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Python 3.8+  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib (optional, for future visualization)  

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SDyChristian/RobotSimControl_project.git
cd robot_project
```

## ðŸ“š Background
This project is part of my ongoing work in robotics and control. It is intended to serve as a base for implementing advanced algorithms in motion planning, dynamics, and control.
